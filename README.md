# batman-ms-pagerduty

## Overview
**batman-ms-pagerduty** is a microservice that integrates with PagerDuty to escalate critical alerts, automate incident responses, and ensure rapid response to Gotham's emergencies. This service ensures that high-priority events are efficiently routed to the appropriate response teams while maintaining flexibility in incident handling.

## Features
- **Custom PagerDuty SDK**: Implements a tailored SDK for PagerDuty since their official SDKs were deprecated, ensuring smooth and reliable integration.
- **Incident Escalation**: Automatically escalates critical alerts to the right responders based on predefined rules.
- **Webhook Listener**: Listens for PagerDuty events and processes them within the Batman ecosystem.
- **Automated Acknowledgment**: Auto-acknowledges incidents when predefined conditions are met.
- **Flexible Routing**: Routes alerts dynamically based on the urgency and category of the event.

## Integration with Batman Ecosystem
batman-ms-pagerduty is deeply integrated into the Batman microservice ecosystem to ensure seamless incident handling:

- **batman-ms-orchestrator**: Triggers incident escalations based on critical alerts detected from various sources like Batcomputer and security monitors.
- **batman-ms-broadcast**: Notifies relevant stakeholders via email, Teams webhooks, and other channels when an incident is created or escalated.
- **batman-ms-security**: Ensures that security-related alerts (e.g., unauthorized access attempts) are processed and escalated immediately.

## Custom PagerDuty SDK Implementation
Due to the deprecation of PagerDuty's official SDKs, batman-ms-pagerduty includes a custom implementation to handle API requests, manage authentication, and interact with PagerDuty efficiently. This custom SDK abstracts the complexity of making raw API calls and provides a cleaner and more maintainable approach to integrating with PagerDuty.

### Example API Workflow
1. **Incident Creation**:
   - Batman-ms-orchestrator detects an issue and triggers an incident creation request.
   - batman-ms-pagerduty formats the request and sends it to PagerDuty via the custom SDK.
2. **Escalation Handling**:
   - If an incident is not acknowledged within a specific timeframe, it is automatically escalated to the next responder.
3. **Notification Dispatch**:
   - Once the incident is created or updated, Batman-ms-broadcast sends alerts via email and Teams.

## Deployment
batman-ms-pagerduty is containerized using Docker and can be deployed using Kubernetes or a serverless environment. Ensure that environment variables for PagerDuty API keys and webhook URLs are configured correctly.

## Future Enhancements
- **AI-based incident prioritization**: Use machine learning models to predict the severity of incidents.
- **Multi-platform support**: Extend support for other incident management platforms beyond PagerDuty.
- **Automated resolution workflows**: Implement auto-remediation for common incidents.

## Conclusion
batman-ms-pagerduty is a critical component of the Batman microservice ecosystem, ensuring that Gotham remains secure by integrating robust incident management capabilities. With its custom SDK and tight integration with Batmanâ€™s systems, it provides a scalable and efficient solution for handling emergencies.
